# My Projects

## Roadmap.sh
My solution (Projects/DevOps/server-stats.sh) to the performance stats exercise: https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats

My solution (DevOps/nginx-log-analyser.sh) to the Nginx Log Analyse exercise: https://roadmap.sh/projects/nginx-log-analyser

Terraform script (main.tf) to create necessary AWS resources for an EC2 instance w/ Fail2ban installed: DevOps/terraform/...

Solution is for https://roadmap.sh/projects/ssh-remote-server-setup and https://roadmap.sh/projects/iac-digitalocean
- To run this you need to have terraform installed w/ aws cli configured, and have created a keypair in the ec2 dashboard. Then use the keypair to ssh into the ec2.



Will revisit log-archive tool later...
